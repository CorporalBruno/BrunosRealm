    - <&5>Loki<&0>: See if having to start your quest to find the airship is any easier from out here in the wildnerness. That ought to slow you down a bit, hahaha!
    - <&4>Bruno<&0>: Your spawnpoint has been set to the Capital City Hospital located at -11715 77 3262. If you wish to change that location you need to sleep in a bed.
    - <&4>Bruno<&0>: You need to make a shelter quickly and sort out your food situation before dark! You have a long journey to begin tomorrow, think like an adventurer! You have to go find that airship and don't forget to bring your Airship Pass!
